I ship out a fair number of routers. Verifying data, configuring the routers, and processing all the paperwork involved was very tedious, so I created a portal to streamline the process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe web-based GUI provides a place to add sites and review deployed router data. This TUI runs on my LAN and automates the process of preparing a router for shipment. It loads a firmware to the router and configures the router for the site. It also uses the UPS API to prepare a label for shipment based on the desired speed of service; it then creates a PDF of the shipping label and spools it to my printer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","Time":"2014-09-26T12:59:11Z","Tags":["Linux","fish","xterm"]}
